```

2. Install dependencies:

```

## Commands

### `!nuke [#channel | channel_id]`

- Clones and deletes the specified channel.
- If no channel is specified, the current channel is nuked.
- Only users with **Administrator, Manage Guild, Manage Channels, and Manage Messages** permissions can use this command.
- Protected channels like **rules**, **system**, and **updates** cannot be nuked.

```bash
!nuke #general
```

### `!invite`

- Generates an OAuth2 invite link with administrator permissions.
- Only the bot owner (as set in `.env`) can run this command.

```bash
!invite
```

---

## Permissions Required

The bot needs the following **permissions** to function properly:

- Manage Channels
- Manage Messages
- Administrator (for full compatibility with `invite`)

Make sure to grant these permissions when inviting the bot.

## roubleshooting

- **Bot not responding?**
  - Check if it's online in your server
  - Make sure the prefix in `.env` matches what you're typing
  - Verify that the bot has the required permissions

- **Nuke command not working?**
  - Ensure the user has all the required permissions
  - Check if the channel is a protected system channel
